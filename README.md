* This repository provides R code for reproducing proteomics-based analysis. The code was verified using R 4.2.

* Our proteomics-based analysis identified revealed that low activity in the complement and coagulation cascades pathway (CCCP) and a high abundance of activated CD8 T cells are positive signals corresponding to ICIs. Finally, utilizing machine learning, we successfully identified a set of 10 protein biomarkers, and the constructed model demonstrated excellent performance in predicting response on an independent validation set (N = 14, area under the curve (AUC) = 0.959).
